# Edmonds-Karp-Algorithm
**What this program does:**

It is Edmonds-Karp Algorithm which is used to find maximum flow in a graph/network. Done in javascript. Breadth-first search algorithm was used to find the paths.
No visual representation for this implementation. The answer for maximum flow is given in console output. This was done for my University's algorithms and data structures course.

**How to use it:**

You can include the javascript file in your html file for testing purposes.

**What have I learnt by doing this project:**

* Learnt more about graphs, what is this thing called maximum flow, how it is found and what this algorithm even is

* When program does not work as expected sometimes it is necessary to do refactoring from zero even if you do not feel like doing that.

* Learnt in a hard way why object-oriented-programming is so useful, why it is necessary to write code which is reusable but also easy to read and use.

* It is necessary to test your program during all minor changes so that later on you would not get stuck when something is off.
